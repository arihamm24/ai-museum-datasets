                <h4>WILL CHANGE AS PROJECT PROGRESS. CURRENT TEXT IS FROM OVERLEAF DRAFT</h4>
                <p>This independent study is exploring how datasheets and similar context documents may promote critical reflection and ethical sensitivity with museum datasets for accessiblity. </p>
                <p>The dataset that sparked this independent study was co-created with museum professionals, accessibility experts, and a ChatGPT model. This co-creation process sparked this study's questions about the use of large language models and artificial intelligence in museums/cultural heritage and the influence of domain expertise on the creation and use of datasets for museum content.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>RQ1 – Integration of AI in Museums:</em> In what ways are large language models and other AI systems being integrated into museum practice, and what opportunities and challenges does this raise for content generation and description?</li>
                    <li><em>RQ2 – Ethics and Expertise:</em> How is expertise in the description of museum content defined and evaluated, and in what ways have museum professionals, accessibility experts, and other domain specialists contributed to the shaping of datasets and the training of models for museum purposes?</li>
