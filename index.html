                <h2>Project Synopsis/Abstract</h2>
                <p>This independent study is exploring how datasheets and similar context documents may promote critical reflection and ethical sensitivity with museum datasets for accessibility. To do this, we explore how these documents might be adapted to help museum professionals articulate the ethical, epistemic, and curatorial dimensions of their contributions, as well as how alternative text such as that shown in the dataset below may serve as its own form of context documentation. </p>
                <p>The dataset that sparked this independent study was co-created with museum professionals, accessibility experts, and a ChatGPT model. This co-creation process sparked this study's questions about the use of large language models and artificial intelligence in museums/cultural heritage and the influence of domain expertise on the creation and use of datasets for museum content.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>RQ1 – Human Practice in Authorship:</em> How do museum professionals approach interpretation of artifacts for public understanding and how does the task of making content accessible affect their approaches?</li>
                    <li><em>RQ2 – Alt Text:</em> How is a collection of alt text developed for a paper museum, what are the characteristics of a collection of alt text authored for a paper museum and what are the differences between human vs AI authorship?</li>
                    <li><em>RQ3 – Ethical Use and Training of AI:</em> When employing AI for alt text authorship, what interpretive conventionsdeveloped through domain expertise are challenged and in what ways can AI models be developed to support ethical reflection in cultural interpretation?</li>

                <h2>Human-Authored Dataset</h2>
                <p>With the help of paper museum professionals and accessibility experts, I developed cross-disciplinary expertise necessary to write alt text for museum artifacts. That is, I gained content knowledge to accurately situate the artifacts in the museum's historical and thematic context while also applying the practical knowledge of writing viable, accessible alt text.</p>

                <h2>AI/Human Co-authored Dataset</h2>
                <p>Aplying the domain expertise developed during the first half of the dataset creation, I employed ChatGPT, a Large Language Model, to expedite the process of authoring alt text.</p>
