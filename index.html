                <h2>Project Synopsis/Abstract</h2>
                <p>This independent study is exploring how datasheets and similar context documents may promote critical reflection and ethical sensitivity with museum datasets for accessibility. To do this, we explore how these documents might be adapted to help museum professionals articulate the ethical, epistemic, and curatorial dimensions of their contributions, as well as how alternative text such as that shown in the dataset below may serve as its own form of context documentation. </p>
                <p>The dataset that sparked this independent study was co-created with museum professionals, accessibility experts, and a ChatGPT model. This co-creation process sparked this study's questions about the use of large language models and artificial intelligence in museums/cultural heritage and the influence of domain expertise on the creation and use of datasets for museum content.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>RQ1 – Context of Museum Content Presentation and Interpretation:</em> What are the factors that impact the presentation and interpretation of paper museum content under the directive of creating alternative text labels?</li>
                    <li><em>RQ2 – Ethics and Expertise:</em> How is expertise in the description of museum content defined and evaluated, and in what ways can museum professionals, accessibility experts, and other domain specialists contribute to the shaping of datasets and the training of models for museum purposes?</li>
                    <li><em>RQ3 – Alt Text as Context Documentation:</em> In what ways can alt text function as a form of context documentation within AI-mediated museum workflows, and how might framing alt text as a documentary practice expand current understandings of accessibility, interpretation, and ethical reflection in cultural heritage institutions?</li>
